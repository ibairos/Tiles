<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    Welcome to Tiles! In this game, the objective is to match as many tiles as possible with their equals, trying to do
    it in the fastest way possible.
</p>

<h2>Game Rules</h2>
<li>
    When your turn comes, you have to pick two matching tiles from the board. Be careful because there is a <span
        style="font-weight: bold">time limit</span>,
    and if you go over it, not only will you lose your turn, but you will also lose points!
</li>
<li>
    If you find two matching tiles, you will get points and another turn. Alternatively, if you do not pick the correct
    tiles, it will be your opponents' turn.
</li>
<li>
    Be careful with <span style="font-weight: bold">bombs</span>! If you run into one, not only will you lose your turn,
    but you will also lose some points too.
</li>

<h2>Game Options</h2>
<p>
    The game lets you pick among many options, making the experience highly <span
        style="font-weight: bold">customizable</span>. Among these, we have the following:
</p>
<h3>Columns and rows</h3>
<p>
    Numbers of rows and columns the game board. The resulting number of cards has to be even, for simplicity.
</p>
<p>
    The minimum and maximum columns are 3 and 9, respectively. For rows, the values are 2 and 5.
    and 5x9.
</p>

<h3>Difficulty</h3>
<p>
    The player will be able to choose among 5 levels of difficulty. The difficulty level will be proportional to various
    parameters, among which are:
<li>The points received for each matching tile.</li>
<li>The points subtracted for each exploded bomb.</li>
<li>The points subtracted each time the turn time is exceeded.</li>
<li>The intelligence of the computer (if the game is played against the computer).</li>
</p>

<h3>Time cards stay up</h3>
<p>
    The player will be able to choose the time the cards stay up each time a pair is selected and thus no other card can
    be selected, even when the pair is incorrect.
</p>

<h3>Theme</h3>
<p>
    The player will be able to choose among 3 different preloaded themes (movies, tv shows and music), or import a
    custom one if the player desires.
</p>
<p>
    For that, the user must select the Load Theme button and select a folder with at least 20 image files (the game will
    only load 20). Once the theme is loaded, the player can play with the selected theme. Warning: the images will be
    shown with a 11:16 (vertical) aspect ratio.
</p>

<h3>Opponent</h3>
<p>
    The player will be able to choose among 3 different game modes:
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">One Player</span>: The game will only have one player, and thus the objective will
    be to flip all the tiles as quickly as possible.
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Two Players</span>: The game will have two players that will play against each
    other with alternating turns. The objective will be to achieve a greater score than the opposing player.
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Computer</span>: The game will have two players, the user and the computer itself.
    As the difficulty level is increased, so will the intelligence of the computer, (the randomness of its choices will
    decrease).
</li>
</p>

<h3>Scoring system</h3>
<p>
    The scoring system of this game, as we have mentioned above, will depend proportionally on the level of difficulty
    chosen. The scores will have some base values, used in the first level of difficulty, which will increase with the
    level.
</p>
<p>The parameters depending on the difficulty are explained in the table below:</p>
